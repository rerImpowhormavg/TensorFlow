# TensorFlow
## Tutorials from syntax basics to neural networks 

FYI these codes are written using an ATOM editor with a Hydrogen package extension and I recommend running them in an interactive coding environment. If you prefer not to run these codes inline/ in real-time feel free to copy and paste them in Jupyter notebooks and run in cells, lines, sections, blocks or however you code best! Happy coding &lt;3 

## Installation
The easiest way to download + install this tutorial is by using git from the command-line:

    git clone https://github.com/AstronomerAmber/TensorFlow.git

To run them, you also need the latest version of TensorFlow. To install it:

    pip install tensorflow
or (if you want GPU support):

    pip install tensorflow_gpu    

## Environment
I recommend creating a conda environoment so you do not destroy your main installation in case you make a mistake somewhere:

    conda create --name tf_3.6 python=3.6 ipykernal
You can activate the new environment by running the following (on Linux):

    source activate tf
And deactivate it:

    source deactivate tf
