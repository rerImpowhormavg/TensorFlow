## Tutorials from syntax basics to neural networks 
Follow along weekly as I add in more codes! 
FYI these codes are written using an ATOM editor with a Hydrogen package extension and I recommend running them in an interactive coding environment. If you prefer not to run these codes inline/ in real-time feel free to copy and paste them in Jupyter notebooks and run in cells, lines, sections, blocks or however you code best! Happy coding &lt;3
